# RSRC - Reusable Static/Remote Components
### a.k.a. Web Components without JavaScript*
---

*The current Web Compenent specifications currently require JavaScript to create custom elements, utilize `<template>` elements, and to manage Shadow DOM.

This feels incomplete. It is called ***ht***tp, not ***js***tp, after all.

---

I would call this a polyfill, but since no browsers support anything like this, it's more of an omnifill. The goal is simple: **support statically defined and/or remotely available, easily reusible components, that are defined using only HTML.**
